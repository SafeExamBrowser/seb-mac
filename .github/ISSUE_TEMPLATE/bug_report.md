**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots or a link to a video to help explain your problem.

**Version Information**
Please complete the following information: 
 - OS: [e.g. macOS xx, iOS xx]
 - SEB Version [e.g. SEB 3.3.1]

**Additional Context**
Add any other context about the problem here: Is it happening on specific machines or OS versions only? How many devices are affected? Did you realize any other pattern?

- Always send SEB log files (in directory ~/Library/Logs/Safe Exam Browser/ on Mac, use Settings app / SEB / Initiate Sending Logs to email log files to yourself and attach them here). 
- On iOS/iPadOS, please activate Settings / Privacy & Security / Share iPad Analytics / Share With App Developers, especially if you observed SEB crashes. We then receive anonymized crash reports. 
- Often a test link (send URL and if necessary login/password for a testing/demo account) or an SEB configuration file to reproduce the issue is helpful (remove SEB Quit and Admin passwords!) and compress the .seb file to ZIP to attach here.
